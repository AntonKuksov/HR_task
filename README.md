# HR_Task

I used servlet to listen city code from a client and doPost obtained zip code.
Only for resources I used lib OpenWeatherMap APIs (https://github.com/iamashks/OWM-JAPIs) and for zip code (https://www.zipcodeapi.com/API).

- ### Weather service: returns weather information by city code passed as a parameter in the query string

http://localhost:8080/my-app/

- ### Geo-location service: returns time zone by ZIP code given in the POST

http://localhost:8080/my-app/static/form.html
